# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

I am working on this on my own, and am not a cybersecurity expert. I welcome help in reporting issues and developing this policy.

I will do my best to patch and reduce vulnerabilities of all versions, and might change this in the future...

## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can report a vulnerability using GitHub's private reporting
feature:

1. Go to [github.com/cameronrutherford/cameronrutherford/security](https://github.com/cameronrutherford/cameronrutherford/security).
2. Click "Report a vulnerability" in the upper right corner of that page.
3. Fill out the form and submit your draft security advisory.

More details are available in
[GitHub's docs](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).
