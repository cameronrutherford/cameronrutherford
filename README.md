## About

Check out the rendered HTML version hosted in GitHub pages here:

<https://cameronrutherford.github.io/CameronRutherford>

I render this using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), and build with
[VSCode](https://vscode.dev/) using a [Development
Container](https://containers.dev/).

[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) are used to
enforce both [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) configuration, and
deploy to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

This serves as my resume, blog, and self-referential documentation!

This document is generated by [`index.qmd`](index.qmd).
