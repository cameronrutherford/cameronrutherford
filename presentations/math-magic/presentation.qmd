## Intro

We are going to do our best to have a manim animation as the content for this slide... Let's see how it goes! Maybe we have to pull in the animation from a notebook to the side as an element within this document...

## Bad example

One option that keeps this all quite simple, is to just embed the output of a notebook into this presentation, albeit this has quite a few gotchas, and probably isn't recommended...

::: {.callout-warning}
This video will not play if you try and render it
:::

```markdown
{{< embed manim-test.ipynb#basic-animation >}}
```

Note that unless you are careful, in both the rendered notebook preview, along with the embedded output here will not work.

Yes, while I could just add the media into the site data, there are a few things to consider:

1. I am trying to embed the animation into the revealJS presentation seamlessly, so I need the .json files along with the mp4. This might only be possible in reveal, in which case I will do conditional content to deal with making HTML look nice.
2. If you add all output in media, you will end up caching a whole bunch of information, and it can get very messy.

## Just the background?

## Better example

We can try some silly things with HTML embedding of the video, or getting an iFrame that links to a YouTube video etc:
