## About

This will be where my main resume is rendered, supported by other files?


## Old GitHub resume

{{< include old_resume.qmd >}}

## Notes on Quarto

::: {.callout-note}
I included that old resume as a file itself in `old_resume.qmd`, and then rendered
this in this quarto document using the following snippet:

``` markdown
{{{< include <file_to_include>.qmd >}}}
```

Make sure to change to the correct file when copying.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
Check out the source code for this if you haven't already in the side bar.

In order to render quarto source code without rendering it in a document, you
have to add another `{ }` to your source code, and use a markdown source comment.

I rendered the note above with this source code:

```` markdown
``` markdown
{{{ include <file_to_include>.qmd }}}
```
````

Also, you need to vary the number of backticks when starting the markdown block
compared to the source code you are commenting. I used four `\`` in rednering the
above source code comment, whereas I only used 3 in the above note

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}
If I keep exaplaining this in markdown, it will be recursive. 
Check out the source code on the right sidebar for this (and other) pages if you
 have not already. This is also partly the reason you can't self-reference a file
 and do recursion in quarto.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
Note that there are five types of callouts, including:
`note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.

You can also make collabsable sections!
