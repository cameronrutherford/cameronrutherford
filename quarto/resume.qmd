## Old GitHub resume

Here is my old GitHub resume if you want to see what it used to look like - look how far I have come!

I saw this in a talk about plain text - the Australian flag is bugged on Windows. Since MSFT only added 3 flags to it's base character set, I decided it was a feature, not a bug, and will not be fixing it.

## Git Integration

Similar to the main README that is generted my `index.qmd`, I keep a pdf uploaded to git automatically. This is copied into the right place through the `post-render` stage of quarto, you just have to remember to commit the changes to git:

```{.YAML include="../_quarto.yml" start-line=10 end-line=12}
```

TODO: Write CI pipeline / pre-commit check that ensures that the main README and resume pdf are updated.
