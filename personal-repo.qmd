## About

This origin file is `personal-repo.qmd`. I render this using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), and build with [VSCode](https://vscode.dev/) using a [Development Container](https://containers.dev/).

## Quick Start

Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), VSCode, and configure the [Dev Container Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers). Then using the command pallette, build the container and open this folder.

## Dev Container Configuration

I used Python as the base image, and then install Quarto in the Dockerfile:

```{.Dockerfile include=".devcontainer/Dockerfile"}
```

## Quarto Configuration

### Workflow

Build and render the project using:

```bash
quarto render && quarto preview
```

### Extensions

These all are installed manually from the command line, and are not included in
the Dockerfile. This is because the whole extesion ecosystem works through the
`_extensions` directory.

To install the first extension, I ran:

```bash
quarto add --no-prompt quarto-ext/include-code-files
```
