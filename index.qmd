## About

Check out the rendered HTML version hosted in GitHub pages here:

[https://cameronrutherford.github.io/cameronrutherford](https://cameronrutherford.github.io/cameronrutherford)

I render this using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), and build with [VSCode](https://vscode.dev/) using a [Development Container](https://containers.dev/).

[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) are used to enforce both [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) configuration, and deploy to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

This serves as my resume, blog, and self-referential documentation!
