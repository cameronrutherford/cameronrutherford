# Test `quarto render`

Since some tests won't need to rebuild the container, this is ran to verify the quarto is still valid. If the container is being rebuilt, this test is already ran within the container build action.

# Publish Container

```{.YAML include="../.github/workflows/publish.yml"}
```


# pre-commit

I run pre-commit checks in CI using a GitHub action from [https://github.com/pre-commit/action](https://github.com/pre-commit/action):

```{.YAML include="../.github/workflows/pre-commit.yml"}
```

# GitHub Pages Configuration

There are many ways to deploy Quarto pages. You can read more about choices in
[rendering Quarto in CI](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/ci.html#rendering-for-ci)
here.

## Initial Config

I ran this initially per [the docs](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#publish-action):

```bash
quarto publish gh-pages
```

I then added a GitHub action to auto publish based on what is in the repository based on other people's publish actions:

```{.YAML include="../.github/workflows/publish.yml"}
```

Notice that we also build and publish the devcontainer if necessary, before using that as the base image for the build. Since this only runs once a PR is merged, it doesn't run `quarto render` as the build is assumed to have passed by this point.
