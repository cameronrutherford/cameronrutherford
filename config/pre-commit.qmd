# Inspiration

Because of issues installing on Windwos and line endings getting messed up, I installed [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to fix bugs as they arised.

Future features have been added if a need has been presented.

This is installed in the Dockerfile for you, but you can choose to install this on it's own if you wish to do so without a container. It is especially nice to avoid any platform specific bugs (see [Quickstart](quickstart.qmd)), although your IDE can normally do enough to get you by. GitHub actions will also fix errors for you when possible.

# .pre-commit-config.yml

Inspired by https://gdevops.gitlab.io/tuto_git/tools/pre-commit/repos_hooks/repo_pre_commit_hooks/mixed-line-ending/mixed-line-ending.html:

```{.YAML include="../.pre-commit-config.yaml"}
```

# Usage

Install the hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install --install-hooks
```

Then to run manually without needing a `git commit`:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Otherwise pre-commit checks happen upon each invokation of `git commit`.
