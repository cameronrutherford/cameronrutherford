# Poetry / Poe the Poet config

## WSL

Installed poetry with `brew install pipx` and `pipx install poetry`.

Then installed poethepoet with `brew tap nat-n/poethepoet && brew install nat-n/poethepoet/poethepoet`

On Jan 30, poetry introduced a non-package based option for their files, reducing the metadata that you need to store which is only arguably useful.
