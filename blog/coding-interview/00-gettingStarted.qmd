# Requirements

Since [xeus-cling](https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling) requires a conda based installation (I could have used Spack to install [xeus](https://github.com/spack/spack/blob/develop/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/xeus/package.py), but decided that would be more effort), we will use [Micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/micromamba.html) and inherit from our `quarto-ci` ghcr base image.

This ended up being installed through the Dockerfile in `.devcontainer/blog-codingInterview/Dockerfile` and is available as a dev-container option:

```{.Dockerfile include="../.devcontainer/blog-codingInterview/Dockerfile"}
```

# Running a notebook / example



# TODO

- [ ] Get Jupyter notebook running at all for C++ examples
- [ ] Get single Jupyter notebook rendering in Quarto
- [ ] Render content into blog section of website
- [ ] Solve some hard leetCode problems in separate notebooks
- [ ] Generate feed with content in order of posting
